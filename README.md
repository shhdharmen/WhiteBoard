## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shhdharmen/WhiteBoard.git
cd WhiteBoard
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Scripts

Generally, I would run only below script, all other publish / deploy scripts are run through [Github Actions](.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml).

### yarn start

Start the local development server of Expo CLI. And [open the app on your phone or simulator](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/workflow/up-and-running/#open-the-app-on-your-phone-or).

## Backend

I didn't want to spend much time for backend, so I have used [strapi](strapi.io) to create [White Board Strapi](https://github.com/shhdharmen/white-board-strapi).
